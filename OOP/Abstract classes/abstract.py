#prevents a user from creating a object of that class
# * compels a user to overiide abstract methods in a child class

# abstract class = a class which contains one or more abstract methods 
#abstact methods = a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.
#here we will prevent the vehicle to be created as a object because basically it doesn't contain anything

#Vehicle = Vehicle()  #here the vehicle object will give error
# and also if you print pass in any of the car or motocycle instead of go func which is present 
#inside it will basically consider the default of vehicle which contains the abstract class for the particular function hence gives error
#NOTE - this absract method is for the func inside the Vehicle class not the class itself.
