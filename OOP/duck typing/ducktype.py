#Duck typing - concept where the class of an object is less important than the methods 
#              class type is not checked if minimum methods/attributes are present
#              "If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"
class Duck:

    def walk(self):
        print("This duck is walking")

    def walk(self):
        print("This chiken is walking")

    def talk(self):
        print("This chiken is quawcking ")

class Person():
    def catch(self,duck):
