# The textwrap module provides two convenient functions: wrap() and fill().
# The wrap() function wraps a single paragraph in text (a string) so that every line is width characters long at most.
# It returns a list of output lines.
import textwrap
string = "This is a very very very very very long string."
print (textwrap.wrap(string,8))
#The fill() function wraps a single paragraph in text and returns a single string containing the wrapped paragraph.
string = "This is a very very very very very long string."
print (textwrap.fill(string,8))
